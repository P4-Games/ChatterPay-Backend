  /**
   * Performs a ramp-off operation, which involves selling cryptocurrency and withdrawing the resulting assets automatically.
   * Once the synthetic asset is created, the system will provide the crypto address to which the funds must be sent to trigger the process,
   * along with the supported networks. If insufficient funds are sent, the synthetic will not be processed.
   * If excess funds are sent, they will be processed without issue (all funds received since the creation of the synthetic).
   * For a ramp-off that accumulates funds in the user balance instead of sending them, use the alias 'partial-ramp-off',
   * where the 'withdrawAddress' field becomes optional as only the deposit and order stages will be involved.
   *
   * @param {string} externalId - The external identifier for the ramp-off operation.
   * @param {string} userAnyId - The identifier for the user initiating the operation.
   * @param {string} sessionId - The session ID for the ramp-off operation.
   * @param {string} asset - The asset to sell (e.g., "USDC").
   * @param {string} against - The currency to sell the asset against (e.g., "ARS").
   * @param {string} againstAmount - The amount of the 'against' asset involved in the transaction (e.g., "10.5 ARS").
   * @param {string} priceCode - The price code for the transaction.
   * @param {string} withdrawAddress - The address to withdraw the asset to (optional for partial ramp-off).
